              ...and that is exactly what WE always try to offer. Nothing can
              represent our company better than these words, since our main
              goal, ever since our small begginings, has been to create
              something unique and out-of-the box, a small piece in the size of
              your pocket that you can use everyday, an accessory that inspires
              and forms a connection with you! The idea was first born in the
              summer of 2016, in an ordinnary coffee shop, where 2 friends
              suddenly had a vision: To spread Creativity and Happiness by
              turning a boring everyday essential into a chic and sophisticated
              product! It has definitely been a long way since that time and
              through dedication, those 2 friends were finally able to complete
              their dream and now we are here to present to the world the
              ULTIMATE PHONE CASES - a variety of specially designed and
              personalized and manifactured phone cases, where everyone can
              find a piece of themselves in the colorful and creative models
              here in our website :) Today FunCases is sold in more than 15
              countries and we couldn't be more grateful for every purchase that
              you do. Thank you for helping our bussines grow, for radiating
